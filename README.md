# The Colouriser
Practice website featuring just about every single colour. To view the page, click [here](https://aleifericsson.github.io/the-colouriser/) or use the GitHub pages link under "environments".

Fun fact: this website was coded entirely on an android device (which I would not recommend as an experience).
